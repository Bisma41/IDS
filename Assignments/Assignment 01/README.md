- **Hero Section**: A visually striking header with a creative workspace background to capture attention.
- **Services Section**: Overview of the services offered, including web design, branding, and illustrations.
- **Portfolio Section**: Displays four portfolio mockups showcasing the agency's work.

## Reflection

Working on this project with Git and GitHub provided valuable experience in managing a portfolio project using version control. The branching feature in Git allowed me to work on different parts of the website separately without interfering with the main codebase. 

A minor conflict occurred while merging the portfolio section branch into the main branch, as I had made some changes to the CSS file in both branches. However, using Gitâ€™s conflict resolution tools, I was able to merge the branches successfully after reviewing and testing the changes.
